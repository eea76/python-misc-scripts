#Miscellaneous python scripts

These are a bunch of similar scripts that I wrote mostly while working at EastWest in 2012-2014 to deal with OS operations. Most of them employ the os.walk method to perform generic recursive file operations: rename, copy/move, delete, counts, etc.

Additionally this repo contains scripts that create and modify .mid files (these are primarily useful in the EastWest context for which they were originally written).
